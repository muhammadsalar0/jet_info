                <h1>Thurster</h1>
                <p>The Mirage 2000 is powered by the Snecma M53-P2 turbofan engine, a single-shaft, afterburning engine
                    that provides high thrust and excellent performance for the aircraft. Designed for both high-speed
                    interception and ground attack missions, the M53-P2 delivers about 21,400 lbf of thrust with
                    afterburner, enabling the Mirage 2000 to reach speeds over Mach 2. Its reliable and simple design
                    contributes to the fighter’s agility, fast acceleration, and ease of maintenance, making it a key
                    component of the Mirage 2000’s enduring effectiveness in air forces around the world..</p>

                <h1>AIR Brakes</h1>
                <P>The Mirage 2000 is equipped with effective air brakes located on the upper and lower surfaces of the
                    rear fuselage. These hydraulically operated panels deploy symmetrically to increase drag and rapidly
                    reduce the aircraft's speed during high-speed flight or landing approaches. Their design allows the
                    pilot to decelerate quickly without significantly affecting aircraft stability, making them
                    essential for precise maneuvering during combat and landing operations.. <maneuvers class="1s">
