                    <h1>Thurster</h1>
                    <P>The Su-57 is powered by two advanced turbofan engines, currently the Saturn AL-41F1 with plans to
                        upgrade to the Izdeliye 30 engine in future production models. These thrust-vectoring engines
                        provide exceptional maneuverability, allowing the Su-57 to perform extreme aerobatic maneuvers
                        and maintain control at high angles of attack. The engines produce around 14,500 kgf (142 kN) of
                        thrust each with afterburners and feature 3D thrust vectoring nozzles, which significantly
                        enhance the aircraft's agility in dogfights while also contributing to stealth through flat
                        nozzle design in future variants

                    <h1>AIR Brakes</h1>
                    <P>The Su-57 is equipped with advanced airbrakes integrated into its wing and fuselage design. These
                        airbrakes help reduce speed rapidly during high-speed flight, maneuvers, and landing approaches.
                        Unlike older jets with large, visible panels, the Su-57’s airbrakes are designed to preserve
                        stealth by being flush with the body when not in use. Their placement and operation work in
                        coordination with the aircraft’s flight control system to enhance aerodynamic braking without
                        compromising radar signature or maneuverability. <maneuvers class="1s"></maneuvers>
