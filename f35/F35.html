                    <P>The F-35 Lightning II does not use traditional, dedicated air brakes like some older fighter
                        jets. Instead, it relies on a combination of control surfaces—such as the rudder, ailerons, and
                        horizontal stabilizers—to create aerodynamic drag and slow the aircraft when needed. This design
                        reduces weight and complexity while maintaining stealth characteristics. During landing or
                        deceleration maneuvers, these surfaces work together in a technique called "speed brake mode" to
                        effectively manage speed without compromising the jet's low radar signature <maneuvers
