                <p>
                    The F-35 fighter jet’s thrust comes from its advanced Pratt & Whitney F135 engine, which delivers
                    over 40,000 pounds of thrust, enabling supersonic speeds and exceptional maneuverability. Its
                    afterburner boosts power for rapid acceleration, while specialized nozzle designs enhance stealth by
                    reducing heat and radar signatures. In the F-35B variant, a unique swiveling rear nozzle and lift
                    fan allow vertical takeoff and landing, giving the jet unmatched operational flexibility.

                <h2>Air Brakes</h2>
                <p>
                    The F-35 does not use traditional air brakes like older fighter jets; instead, it relies on a
                    combination of control surfaces—such as its flaperons, rudder, and tail surfaces—to create drag and
                    slow down. By adjusting these surfaces in opposite directions, the aircraft can decelerate
                    efficiently without adding large external panels that would affect stealth. This integrated braking
                    system helps maintain the F-35’s low radar signature while still allowing precise speed control
                    during landing and combat maneuvers.
