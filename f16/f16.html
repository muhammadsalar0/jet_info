                    <P>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is equipped with a Pratt & Whitney F100 or General Electric F110
                        afterburning turbofan engine, both of which feature a variable-area convergent-divergent (CD)
                        nozzle
                        known as a thrust vectoring nozzle. This engine produces up to 29,000 pounds of thrust with
                        afterburner, enabling the F-16’s high speed, agility, and combat performance. The engine
                        includes a
                        digital electronic control system for precise management of thrust, fuel flow, and engine
                        parameters. Its compact and efficient design contributes to the F-16’s reputation as a highly
                        maneuverable multirole fighter</P>

                    <h1>AIR Brakes</h1>
                    <P>The F-16 Fighting Falcon is equipped with a split-type air brake located on the upper fuselage
                        just
                        behind the cockpit. This air brake consists of two panels that open upward and downward to
                        create
                        drag and help decelerate the aircraft rapidly during flight or landing. Controlled
                        hydraulically,
                        the air brake enhances maneuverability by allowing quick speed reduction, especially during
                        combat
                        or approach phases. Its design minimizes impact on the aircraft’s aerodynamic stability,
                        maintaining
                        control even during aggressive braking <maneuvers class="1s"></maneuvers>
