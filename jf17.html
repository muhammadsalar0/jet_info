                    <h1>Thurster</h1>
                    <p>The JF-17 Thunder is powered by the Klimov RD-93 afterburning turbofan engine, a variant of the
                        Russian RD-33 used in the MiG-29. This engine produces around 18,000 to 19,000 pounds of thrust
                        with afterburner, enabling the JF-17 to achieve supersonic speeds and agile maneuverability. The
                        RD-93 features a modular design for easier maintenance and includes an afterburner section for
                        increased thrust during combat or high-speed flight. While not as powerful as engines in larger
                        fighters, it provides a good balance of performance, reliability, and cost for a lightweight
                        multirole aircraft like the JF-17.</p>

                    <h1>AIR Brakes</h1>
                    <P>The JF-17 Thunder is equipped with a single air brake located on the underside of the fuselage,
                        just behind the main landing gear. This hydraulically operated air brake helps reduce the
                        aircraft’s speed during descent, landing, or combat maneuvers. By increasing aerodynamic drag,
                        it allows for quicker deceleration without significantly affecting stability. Its simple and
                        robust design complements the JF-17’s lightweight and cost-effective structure, enhancing
                        operational control during various flight phases. <maneuvers class="1s"></maneuvers>
