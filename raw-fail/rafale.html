                <p>
                 The Dassault Rafale is powered by two Snecma M88-2 turbofan engines, each producing around 7,500
                        kgf (75 kN) of thrust with afterburner. These engines are compact, reliable, and designed for
                        high performance across a wide flight envelope, enabling the Rafale to reach speeds up to Mach
                        1.8. While the M88-2 does not have thrust vectoring like the Su-57, it offers excellent throttle
                        response and fuel efficiency, supporting long-range missions. The engines are also optimized for
                        low infrared signature and reduced maintenance, aligning with the Rafaleâ€™s multirole versatility
                        and carrier-operating needs.

                <h2>Air Brakes</h2>
                <p>
                The Dassault Rafale features advanced aerodynamic airbrakes integrated into its design to enhance
                        deceleration and maneuvering. The primary airbrake is located on the upper fuselage behind the
                        cockpit, and additional braking is assisted by the aircraft's canards and control surfaces.
                        These elements work together to rapidly reduce speed during landing approaches or combat
                        maneuvers without compromising stability. The Rafale's airbrake system is seamlessly managed by
                        the flight control computer, allowing precise, automatic deployment to maintain agility and
                        control during high-speed operations
