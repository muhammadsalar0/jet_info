                <p>
                    The JF-17 Thunder, also known as the FC-1 Xiaolong in China, is a lightweight, multi-role combat
                    aircraft developed jointly by Pakistan and China. One of its key components is the engine, or
                    thruster, which powers the jet and provides it with high agility and speed. The JF-17 is primarily
                    equipped with the Russian-designed Klimov RD-93 turbofan engine, a variant of the RD-33 used in the
                    MiG-29. This engine delivers a thrust of about 49.4 kN dry and 84.4 kN with afterburner, enabling
                    the JF-17 to reach speeds up to Mach 1.6. Efforts have also been made to explore Chinese
                    alternatives like the WS-13 engine for future variants

                <h2>Air Brakes</h2>
                <p>
                    The JF-17 Thunder is equipped with air brakes designed to enhance its maneuverability and control
                    during high-speed flight and landing. These air brakes are located on the sides of the fuselage,
                    just behind the cockpit area. When deployed, they increase drag, allowing the aircraft to decelerate
                    rapidly without relying solely on engine thrust reduction or aerodynamic surfaces. This feature is
                    especially useful during combat maneuvers and landing approaches, giving pilots better control over
                    speed and positioning. The air brakes are hydraulically operated and integrated into the flight
                    control system for efficient and responsive handling.
